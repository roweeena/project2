# RPG Character Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find the live link  [here](https://roweeena.github.io/project2/#/)

The project is an RPG character generator where the user can customise their character by clicking on individual items and accessories to render an image of a character based on the online RPG game *MapleStory*.

Completed as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course.

**Dependencies**
This project was built with
* Ruby on Rails
* React
And uses `bcrypt` and `rack-cors` as gems, as well as the `lodash` library in React. We also used the [_MapleStory.io_ API resource](https://maplestory.io/) to get the items and accessory images.
